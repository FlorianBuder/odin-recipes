    <h3>
      Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe
      and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of
      chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - <br />
        pounded to Â½-inch thickness
      </li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour,
        beaten egg, <br />
        and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in
        flour, <br />
        shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs
        <br />
        until well coated on both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the
        hot oil, <br />
        and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper
        towel-lined <br />
        plate to drain.
      </li>
    </ol>
